# zfs-replicator
Incremental ZFS replicator for FreeBSD and ZFS-on-Linux

USAGE (should be used with crontab): zfs-replicator.sh (generation-name) (number of snapshots to keep)

This script recursively snapshots a given pool, and replicates it to another host (slave). It supports grandfathering schemes (generations) on both master and slave (mirrored), all controlled from the master with this script and crontab.
Only the first snapshot will be sent in 100% size, all following snapshots will be sent incrementally.

If the slave is down, or the script is already running, a snapshot will still be taken, and it will be synced with other missed snapshots when the slave is up again. While the slave is down, no cleaning will be done on the master or the slave, so snapshots will build up on the master until the slave is synced again. As soon as the master and slave are in sync again, cleaning will kick in and obey the keep rule(s).
If you are running multible generations, cleaning of the individual generation will not interfer with other generations.

This script was created because i needed something that worked on both FreeBSD and Linux (ZFS-on-Linux), and all the other scripts i tried failed or didn't work, or were too complicated for me to make work.

This script has been worked on over time, and was started to just take snapshots one at a time and send them to a slave.
I started out with a script i found here: http://www.aisecure.net/2012/01/11/automated-zfs-incremental-backups-over-ssh/ and worked on that. Over time a lot of stuff was added here and there, then was rewritten, moved around, more functionality added, more moving arround, rewritten, and so on and so on. Therefore some logic might seem weird in some places, but a lot of it will take care of unexpected situations i ended up in, and now this has been running in production on some of my systems, both Linux and FreeBSD, and seem to be running error free.

Yes there are maybe too many ssh calls, and there are alot of stuff that could be done better, but you are welcome to run with this, and do whatever you want with it.

You can find documentation and how to use it in the script itself.

Enjoy :)
