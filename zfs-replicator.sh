# DISCLAIMER: YOU RUN THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! If you don't agree with that, don't run this script.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# USAGE (should be used with crontab): zfs-replicator.sh <generation-name> <number of snapshots to keep>
#
# This script recursively snapshots a given pool, and replicates it to another host (slave). It supports grandfathering schemes (generations)
# on both master and slave (mirrored), all controlled from the master with this script and crontab.
# Only the first snapshot will be sent in 100% size, all following snapshots will be sent incrementally.
#
# If the slave is down, or the script is already running, a snapshot will still be taken, and it will be synced with other missed snapshots
# when the slave is up again. While the slave is down, no cleaning will be done on the master or the slave, so snapshots will build up on the
# master until the slave is synced again. As soon as the master and slave are in sync again, cleaning will kick in and obey the keep rule(s).
# If you are running multible generations, cleaning of the individual generation will not interfer with other generations.
#
# BE VERY CAREFUL WITH "zfs destroy -r":
# If you destroy a filesystem on the master, it will destroy the filesystem on the slave too, including all the snapshots (across all generations)
# for that filesystem, with a single run of the script. This is as intended, as it is the way recursive zfs send and receive work, and as it comes
# in handy when you really want the data deleted forever. So if you need the snapshots kept, don't destroy the filesystem, delete the data inside
# the filesystem instead, and destroy it when it has "trickeled through" your generations.
#
# For this script to work, ssh keys with no passphrase must first be set up so that a user (ex. root) can ssh from the master to the slave without
# being prompted for login.
#
# Example of use with crontab (*1min schedule should only be used for testing, or on pools with few filesystems and low io).
#
# 1-4/1,6-9/1,11-14/1,16-19/1,21-24/1,26-29/1,31-34/1,36-39/1,41-44/1,46-49/1,51-54/1,56-59/1 * * * *  root    /root/zfs-replicator.sh 1min 5
# 5,10,20,25,35,40,50,55 * * * *           root   /root/zfs-replicator.sh 5min 3
# 15,30,45 * * * *                         root   /root/zfs-replicator.sh 15min 4
# 0 1-5,7-11,13-17,19-23 * * *             root   /root/zfs-replicator.sh 1hour 6
# 0 0,6,12,18 * * *                        root   /root/zfs-replicator.sh 6hour 9
#
# The example is set on FreeBSD. On linux you might need to remove "root" before the command entry.
# This would give you 1 snapshot every minute for 5 minutes, 1 snapshot every 5 minutes for 15 minutes, 1 snapshot every 15 minutes for 1 hour,
# 1 snapshot every hour for 6 hours, and 1 snapshot every 6 hours for 2 days* (* 2 day = 8 snapshots. The 9 in the example is because you need
# one extra snapshot in the end to be able to go 2 whole days back, or that snapshot will just have have been destroyed, and you could now only
# go 1 day and 18 hours back. This is not a problem for 1min, 5min, 15min or 1hour schedules in the above example, as they all overlap 1 snapshot
# with the next generation.
#
# * 1min schedule will most likely only work smoothly with very few filesystems with nearly no writing IO, as it can take some time to sync each 
# filesystem. This would give you a lot of overlapping script-executions, and you will end up with a snapshot backlog, which would probably
# result in even more overlapping script-executions, and so on. Adjust your lowest snapshot increment so that there on average is enough time to
# transfer everything incrementally to the slave. Because the script picks up snapshots missed for transfer on the next round, it is ok if it
# doesn't make it on time every time, but if your increments are set too often, you are probably in for a bumpy ride.
#
# If you want to be extra sure that you get monitor-output if the script fails, run it in crontab like this:
# 15,30,45 * * * *  root   /root/zfs-replicator.sh 15min 4 || echo "SCRIPT-FAILED: Sync script failed - Check manually!!!" >> /path/to/monitor-file.txt
